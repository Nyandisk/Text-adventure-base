# A simple and slightly buggy text adventure game base with a simple example included

Example files, in case you want to delete them are
 - ParkingLot.cs
 - ShoppingCart.cs

Example files, that are also part of the engine but that have some lines worth removing are
 - GlobalIdentification.cs
 
 
Download it, and then view the example provided if you wanna do anything.

somewhat working docs (dont view files, instead use packages, files seem to not work.)
